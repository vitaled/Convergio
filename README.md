## 🎯 The Agentic Manifesto

> *"Human purpose. AI momentum."* — Milano, 23 June 2025

Convergio is built upon the foundational principles of **The Agentic Manifesto**, ensuring our AI-powered platform serves humanity while maintaining ethical standards and inclusive design.

### What We Believe
1. **Intent is human, momentum is agent** — You set the direction, AI provides the execution power
2. **Impact must reach every mind and body** — Universal accessibility and inclusive design
3. **Trust grows from transparent provenance** — Every decision includes reasoning and attribution
4. **Progress is judged by outcomes, not output** — Results matter more than activity volume

### How We Act
1. **Humans stay accountable** for all decisions and effects
2. **Agents amplify capability**, never replace human identity
3. **We design from the edge first**: disability, language, connectivity
4. **Safety rails precede scale** — Security and ethics built-in
5. **Learn in small loops, ship value early** — Continuous improvement
6. **Bias is a bug** — we detect, test, and fix continuously
